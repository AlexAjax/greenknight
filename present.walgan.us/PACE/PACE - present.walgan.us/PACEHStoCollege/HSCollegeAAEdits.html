<h1>From High School to College</h1>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Step 1: Movement into Independence</h2>
<h4 class="fragment roll-in">You are are moving into adult-to-adult and adult-to-community relationships, conversations and responsibilities.</h4>
</section>

<section>
<h3>You bring something to the table.</h3>
<p class="fragment roll-in">You are learning to have your own voice and decision-making power.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">You'll discover and offer your own ideas and identities while interacting with other adults.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">Though you'll need to follow some basic guidelines, you can direct your studies as you like.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Step 2: Selecting Courses</h2>
<h4 class="fragment roll-in">When you select courses, you bring together their hopes, conversations, and community guidelines.</h4>
</section>

<section>
<h3> Reflect on their reasons for taking a course!</h3>
<p class="fragment roll-in">Your reasons will help you think about the balance between your own voice and your communities' voices.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p >Knowing your reasons for taking a course can help you adjust when something doesn't go as planned.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">You should be able to give a variety of reasons for taking the courses in your schedule.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">Students frequently take a course for one reason, and find out that there were other good reasons.</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>Course descriptions, instructor biographies (or publications), and other students might help you determine whether your interests and personality fit with a course.</p> 
<p class="fragment roll-in">The Atlas will help determine schedule fit and whether a course fulfills a GER.</p> 
<p class="fragment roll-in">The Catalog can help determine whether a course fulfills other requirements.</p> 
</section>
<section>
<p>There are many good reasons to take a course:</p>
<ul>
<p class="fragment roll-in">It fulfills a GER.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">It fulfills a major requirement.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">It fulfills a minor requirement.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">It fulfills an elective requirement.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">I am interested in the topic.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">It fits my schedule.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">Someone said I should.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in">I like working with the people who are taking or teaching the class.</p>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h3> You have the final word on your academic schedules and success</h3> 
<h4>but not the power to make everything happen as you wish.</h4>
<p class="fragment roll-in">The key to success (even for building schedules) is not luck, but how many different ways you can pursue and adjust (customize, recreate, revise) your plans.</p>
</section>

<section>

<h2>Step 3: Asking for Help</h2>
<h4 class="fragment roll-in">Adults are responsible, but not omnipotent.</h4>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Other people can help you see more ways to pursue and adjust your plans.</h4>
<h4 class="fragment roll-in">They can fix some problems, and help you adjust to problems that can't be fixed.</h4>
<h4 class="fragment roll-in">All the Orientation materials and these particular OUE staff people want to help you find new ways pursue and adjust your plans, or show you where to find people who can.</h4>
</section>
<section>
<h3>Engaging with Others is Critical for Success</h3>
<h4 class="fragment roll-in"> All adults sometimes need more ways to pursue and adjust our plans. Sometimes it takes us a while to catch on.</h4>
<h4 class="fragment roll-in"> Conversations help us see when we need to adjust our plans, and what kinds of plans we might best build.</h4>

</section>

<section>

<h2>Step 4: Time Management</h2>
<h4 class="fragment roll-in">No one has mastered it, but other people (esp. in EPASS, Health, and PACE) are happy to tell you what they've learned about managing time, and to suggest ways you might learn to do it yourself.</h4>
</h3>
</section>
<section>
<h4>Key Elements in the Transition to College</h4>
<p class="fragment roll-in"><em>Sleep.</em> Without sleep, it's difficult to pursue and adjust plans, set priorities, enjoy relationships, and manage your time. Most of the time, sleep is a good top priority.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in"><em>Priorities.</em>  Long-term plans help us decide what is most important. If you don't have a clear long-term plan, building one is your short-term plan.</p>
<p class="fragment roll-in"><em>Social life.</em>  Integrate relationships into your long-term plans so that your career goals and your social needs don't seem to be at odds with one another. Sometimes social needs are a priority; sometimes study-time is a priority, and both are part of a long-term plan. </p>
