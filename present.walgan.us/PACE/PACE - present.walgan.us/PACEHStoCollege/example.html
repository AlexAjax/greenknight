					## We're pretty good at the technical skills
					## We're pretty good at explaining policy info 
					(though we can do better) 

					---

					##We've got a lot of room for improvement on the affective register

					---

					#What do we want? 
					- want students to have the sense that the 1st year academic advising folks in the oue are the duc of academic life. - the place you can go when you're feeling lost, overwhelmed, unclear, etc., and know that someone will know which direction to point you. 

					---

					#How to get what we want?

					---

					#We need to build rapport
 
					- first impressions are really important 

					---

					#The material
					- something clear, straightforward that gives them a sense of mastery (the sense of i aced that test, so i'll probably do okay on x)

					---

					- students appreciate straightforward explanations of materials in which they have a vested interest
					- not necessarily for them to think it's entertaining or enjoyable
					(cf. the summer sessions in PACE 101; GREs are GREs.) 

					---

					#Feelings/affective factors we need to take into account 
					- overwhelmed
					- disappointment about not getting classes
					- anxiety 
					- disorientation
					- confidence 
					- reassurance 
					- passion - interests
					- anticipation
					- locus ofcontrol 
					- mastery - knowledge 
					- competence
